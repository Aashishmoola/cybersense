General styling guidelines
    1. Always write hardcoded constants in CAPS to dintinguish form codeActionsOnSave
    2. When refrerring to react components, must capitalise component name, else starts with lowercase
        Ex: productData ( data relating to product), Product (Component), ProductPropsType(Type to check props in Product)
    3. Name files in snake_case and items within code to be camelCase
    4. Component file name must match the component being exported in the file
    5. Each file can only export 1 Component
    6. Each function should have max of 10 lines while ideally having around 5, to ease debugging (find error source) and encapulate logic easily
    

Common coding Errors
    1. UseState is used only when a rerendering of dispayed components is needed
    2. UseEffect is only intended for handling SideEffects (data fetching, data logging)
    3. Poorly handling async conditions 
        -lead to race conditions
