How to pull, edit and push repo to github:
1. Pull (combination of fetch and merge (to local main branch)) from remote repo (Github) 's main branch
    git pull origin main (while on main branch)
2. Create and switch to a new feature branch locally
    git switch -c new_branch_name
3. Stage files (if necessary)
    git add filename
4. Commit staged files 
    git commit -m "Add commit message here" 
    git commit -a -m "Add commit message here" (If want to skip staging process)
5. Push to remote repo 
    git push origin working_branch_name (NOT main)
6. Create a pull request on Github
    Github will handle merging working_branch to main in remote repo
7. Repeat steps 2-5 if working on same feature/branch
    Do not pull from main into local working branch ever

Common errors while using git with github:
1. Working directly on local main instead of local feature branches
    -can't work on multiple feature at the same time
    -can't revert to local backup
    -commit history cotains commits of many features, difficult to parse through
2. Not updating local main before creating new branches 
    -using outdated code to work on new edits
3. Creating branches from local branches when not necessary (creating subfeature branch on a feauture branch)
    -using outdated code to work on new edits
    -merging and handling merge conflicts gets more complex as branches are getting nested more than 1 level
4. Pushing directly to main 
    -code will not be reviewed, tested as it breaks development pipeline
    -may lead to unnecessary merge conflicts
5. Working in /naming branches something irrevelant to feature being worked on/ working on all features on single branch
    - harder to track feature development status
    - does not allow multiple people to work to feature branch simultaneously
